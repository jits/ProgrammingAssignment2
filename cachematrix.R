# Helper functions to compute and cache the inverse of a matrix (i.e. "solve" a

# Given an initial matrix, this method returns a special wrapper, in the form of
# a list with functions that can be used to:
# - set the underlying matrix again
# - get the underlying matrix
# - set the inverse of the underlying matrix
# - get th inverse of the underlying matrix
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  i <- NULL  # Cache value for the inverse matrix of `x`
  
  # Setter method, if we want to overwrite the underlying matrix `x`
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    i <<- NULL
  }
  
  # Getter method, to access the underlying matrix `x`

    x
  }
  
  # Set the inverse of the underlying matrix `x`, into the cache
  setinverse <- function(inverse) {

# Use this method to "solve" (i.e. get the inverse) of a matrix, doing so in a
# way that caches the very first computation of the inverse and uses the cache
# subsequently.

# The argument `x` MUST be the special wrapper obtained from `makeCacheMatrix`.
